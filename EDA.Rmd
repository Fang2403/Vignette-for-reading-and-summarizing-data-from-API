```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
```

This document is a vignette to show how to retrieve data from an API. To demonstrate, I'll be interacting with the Polygon.io API. I am going to build a few functions to interact with some of the endpoints and explore aome of the data I can retrieve. 

As a note, 

## Required Packages

I used the following packages to interact with API and analyse the data:

* httr: importing files from Web APIs 

* dplyr: manipulating data 

* jsonlite: converting JSON data to R objects

* ggplot2: visualizing the data

* purrr: maping summary to all columns by group

```{r}
library(httr)
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
```


## API Interaction Functions

I define some functions to interact with Polygon.io API and return well-formatted data.
